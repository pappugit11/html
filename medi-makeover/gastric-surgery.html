               </div>
               <p>Gastric sleeve surgery, or sleeve gastrectomy, is for weight loss that involves removing approximately 80% of the stomach. Gastric Sleeve Surgery is the most popular weight loss operation in the world as it induces rapid and significant weight loss.
                <br><br>

                After the surgery, you will feel full after eating a small amount of food. The surgery also shrinks your appetite because a smaller stomach will produce lower levels of a hormone called ghrelin, which causes hunger.</p>

Medi Makeovers will advise you of this directly from your surgeon, and will advise you about any changes you need to make to medicines and your diet in the weeks or days before surgery. And you will need to stop eating and drinking the night before you have the surgery. Full advice will be given to you pre surgery.

If you have sleep apnoea (sleep apnoea is when you stop breathing for a period during sleep) you will be required to bring your own CPAP machine to Thailand and you must use it or minimum 2 weeks prior to surgery.

                <p>Initially you’ll take small sips of liquid throughout the day. Once
                  you tolerate liquids, you will be able to start on pureed foods. At around four weeks after surgery, you can start adding soft foods to your diet and after six weeks you should be able
                  to resume a normal solid food diet. The gastric sleeve will allow you to eat almost any type or texture of food. Obviously high-calorie and high-fat foods and drinks should be avoided.<br>
                  Many bariatric surgeons recommend eating five small, healthy meals a day with no snacking in-between meals.
                  <br><br>
                  During the first two years after gastric sleeve surgery, when most weight loss is expected to occur, the diet is limited to 600 to 800 calories a day. Once a patient achieves their goal
                  weight, they are usually able to eat about 1000 to 1200 calories a day. <br>For a more in depth look at a diet after a sleeve gastric sleeve, <a href="#">click here</a>.

                  The weight loss then becomes less as you get closer to your target weight. <br><br>
                  
                  By the end of the first year, you could hope to have lost about 63 percent of your excess weight and up to 70 percent after two years.

                  The amount and speed of weight loss is up to you - The gastric sleeve procedure will help you to control your hunger and limit the
                   amount of food you can eat at any one time but the amount of weight you lose and the speed at which it comes off will depend on
                    your adoption and commitment to a new lifestyle, healthy diet, and regular exercise.<br><br>
                  
                  You will need to keep to your limited calorie intake. Most people reach a weight plateau at some point and when this happens, you’ll 
                  need to consider increasing your exercise in terms of length, type and pace. Keep motivated and celebrate your successes and you’ll

                  If you have gastric sleeve surgery, you will first start with liquid foods. Over the next few weeks, you will change to pureed food, then to solid food. Your meals will be much smaller and you may have to stop drinking with meals due to your small stomach. Your surgeon will give you a comprehensive diet to follow for the following 3-6 months.

                  <br><br>
                  Your meals will be much smaller than before. And you will probably take vitamins or other supplements for life. It is very important to eat the correct foods post-surgery to ensure you are receiving all the correct nutrients that your body will need now that you are only able to
                  eat smaller amounts of food. This is not the time to continue with the bad choices you may have made pre surgery. If you ate healthily pre surgery, then this is great and now the portions will be smaller, but if you did not have a healthy diet pre surgery, it is very important to now chose the correct foods so that you now receive the correct nutrients for
                  your body. Medi Makeovers will supply you with all the information you will need for the following 12 months post-surgery. You will also have to, and be able to, increase the amount of physical activity you do.

              <h3>Can Your Stomach Be Stretched Post-Surgery?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <div class="gastric-surg-cont">
                <p>The truth is, the stomach will stretch—it’s designed to stretch when you eat—but it will also contract. That said, it’s important to understand that regularly stretching the stomach could lead to a permanent increase in the size of the stomach, and that could lead to weight gain. The inner walls of the stomach are made of tissues called Rugae that expand
                  and contract as a response to food entering and going out of the stomach.<br><br>
                  
                  When the stomach reaches capacity, it alerts your body that it’s full so you will stop eating. When a person overeats, the
                   stomach stretches even more to accommodate the extra food. If this is a rare occurrence, the stomach will simply shrink back 
                   to the previous size. If overeating happens regularly, the stomach may grow permanently larger. Additionally, the body may not recognize when the stomach is full, and therefore may not be able to signal you to stop eating. 
                  
               </p>

              <div class="gastric-surg-cont">
                <p>Furthermore, your stomach may activate feelings of hunger when the stomach is still half full. Essentially, when your stomach permanently stretches, your hunger and “full” signals can become confused. As a result, you can gain weight, even after gastric sleeve surgery.
                  <br><br>
                  The important thing to remember is that the stomach can and will stretch a small amount—that’s normal. But you must be careful not to routinely overeat or weight gain can occur. By adhering to your surgeons’ instructions, 
                  you can develop healthy eating habits and increase the likelihood of long-term weight loss success.

                      We will discuss with our surgeon if you are a good candidate for gastric sleeve surgery or not. Assuming you are a good candidate, we will confirm that you can undergo surgery and provide you with a quote.
                      <br> <br>
                      You can then make a booking for surgery. You will need to spend a minimum of 14 nights in Bangkok; you can, of course, stay longer. During your stay, you will spend 4 nights in the hospital. We will look after all appointments and book your hotel. You can bring someone with you, or you can travel alone.

                                <p>If you are considering surgery, you are likely to need different tests to make sure that gastric sleeve surgery is right for you. Medi Makeovers will advise you of this directly from your surgeon, and will advise you about any changes you need to make to medicines and your diet in the weeks or days before surgery. And you will need to stop eating and drinking the night before you have the surgery. Full advice will be given to you pre surgery.

                                  You may also be required to have a sleep test to see if you are suffering from sleep apnoea. If you have sleep apnoea (sleep apnoea is when you stop breathing for a period during sleep) you will be required to bring your own CPAP machine to Thailand and you must use it or minimum 2 weeks prior to surgery.

                                <p>Initially you’ll take small sips of liquid throughout the day. Once you tolerate liquids, you will be able to start on pureed foods. At around four weeks after surgery, you can start adding soft foods to your diet and after six weeks you should be able to resume a normal solid food diet. The gastric sleeve will allow you to eat almost any type or texture of food. Obviously high-calorie and high-fat foods and drinks should be avoided. Many bariatric surgeons 
                                  recommend eating five small, healthy meals a day with no snacking in-between meals.<br><br>
                                  During the first two years after gastric sleeve surgery, when most weight loss is expected to occur, the diet is limited to 600 to 800 calories a day. Once a patient achieves their goal weight, they are usually able to eat about 1000 to 1200 calories a day. For a more in depth look at a diet after a sleeve

                                   Most weight loss in the first six months .You can expect most of your weight loss to occur in the first six months and this can be as much as 50 percent of your excess weight.  When you start your gastric sleeve diet you won’t
                                    eat much at all as your body needs to get used to the new stomach size and tolerate different foods again whilst you’re also moving through the different stages of food texture.<br><br>

                                    The weight loss then becomes less as you get closer to your target weight.  By the end of the first year, you could hope to have lost about 63 percent of your excess weight and up to 70 percent after two years.

                                <p>Rapid substantial weight loss can help obese patients to become more active more quickly. Carrying less weight around means it’s easier to be more energetic. Walking is a good starting point for many bariatric patients. Exercise and activity can be built up over time. The increase in physical activities will help with weight loss
                                   by burning calories whilst also improving a person’s the quality of life.

                                   Fast weight loss should also provide you with plenty of motivation. As you drop inches off of your waist enjoy buying clothes that are smaller and be proud of your weight loss achievements.  Find your way to keep enthusiastic about your weight loss plan following gastric sleeve surgery. 
                                   <br><br>
                                   Substantial weight loss may also lead to dramatic improvement, and even complete remission, of many of the obesity-related co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes. The amount and speed of weight loss is up to you - The gastric sleeve procedure will help you to control your hunger and limit the amount of food you can eat at any one time but the amount of weight you lose and the speed at which it comes off will depend on your
                                    adoption and commitment to a new lifestyle, healthy diet, and regular exercise.

                                    You will need to keep to your limited calorie intake. Most people reach a weight plateau at some point and when this happens, you’ll need to consider increasing your exercise in terms of length, type and pace. Keep motivated and celebrate your successes and you’ll enjoy realising your weight 
                                    loss and getting closer to your weight loss goal.

                                  If you have gastric sleeve surgery, you will first start with liquid foods. Over the next few weeks, you will change to pureed food, then to solid food. Your meals will be much smaller and you may have to stop drinking with meals due to your small stomach. Your surgeon will give you a comprehensive diet to follow for the following 3-6 months.

                                  Your meals will be much smaller than before. And you will probably take vitamins or other supplements for life. It is very important to eat the correct foods post-surgery to ensure you are receiving all the correct nutrients that your body will need now that you are only able to
                                  eat smaller amounts of food. This is not the time to continue with the bad choices you may have made pre surgery. If you ate healthily pre surgery, then this is great and now the portions will be smaller, but if you did not have a healthy diet pre surgery, it is very important to now chose the correct foods so that you now receive the correct nutrients for your body. Medi Makeovers will supply you with all the information you will need for the following 12 months post-surgery. You will also have to, and be able to, increase the amount of physical activity you do.

                                  <li>Instead of totally limiting every aspect of your diet, give yourself a reward once a week with a special treat limited in size</li>
                                  <li>If you do have a bigger than normal meal, do not make it a habit, make your next meal small and get back on track.</li>
                                  <li>Spare some time for exercise in your daily routine such as yoga, meditation, walking, and light weight lifting</li>
                                  <li>Consume no less than 90 grams of protein per day. This will give you the nutrients your body needs and will help you feel fuller for longer</li>

                                <p>The truth is, the stomach will stretch—it’s designed to stretch when you eat—but it will also contract. That said, it’s important to understand that regularly stretching the stomach could lead to a permanent increase in the size of the stomach, and that could lead to weight gain. The inner walls of the stomach are made of tissues called Rugae that expand 
                                  and contract as a response to food entering and going out of the stomach.<br><br>
                                  When the stomach reaches capacity, it alerts your body that it’s full so you will stop eating. When a person overeats, the stomach stretches even more to accommodate the extra food. If this is a rare occurrence, the stomach will simply shrink back to the previous size. If overeating happens regularly, the stomach may grow permanently larger. Additionally, the body may not recognize when the stomach is 
                                    full, and therefore may not be able to signal you to stop eating. <br><br>
                                    Furthermore, your stomach may activate feelings of hunger when the stomach is still half full. Essentially, when your stomach permanently stretches, your hunger and “full” signals can become confused. As a
                                     result, you can gain weight, even after gastric sleeve surgery.<br><br>
                                     The important thing to remember is that the stomach can and will stretch a small amount—that’s normal. But you must be careful not to routinely overeat or weight gain can occur. By adhering to your surgeons’ instructions, you can develop healthy eating habits and increase the likelihood of long-term weight loss success.
