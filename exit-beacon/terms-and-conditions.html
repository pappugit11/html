                <!-- <p class="tc_top_hgng">Services are provided by Exit Beacon under the following terms and conditions:</p> -->
                <p>Please note subscription payments made through the Exit Beacon website are stored securely and will renew automatically. Failure to request subscription cancellation will result in your account being renewed automatically, for which no refunds will be permitted upon dismissed renewal notifications.</p>
                <p>Service is provided either on a monthly, six monthly or annual subscription with fees taken automatically until cancelled.</p>
                <p>Subscriptions are for one user only. Usernames and passwords must not be given out nor used by anyone else other than the named subscriber to access the Report. Subscribers may also access the site from a mobile device or home computer. Additional subscriptions may be purchased for a reduced amount by contacting us.</p>
                <p>You will keep your usernames and passwords secret and will not disclose them to third parties for any purpose. You will notify us and change any password which you believe may have been compromised.</p>
                <p>Due to the nature of the information being sold, we unfortunately cannot accept returns of subscriptions, reports, articles or lists once they have been delivered. We therefore cannot issue a refund for a subscription or a renewal after it has been processed and the subscriber has used their log-in details to access the member-only sections of our website.</p>
                <p>Refunds will be given at the discretion of the Company Management. Any claim for a refund must be made within 14 days.</p>
                <p>Unsubscribing: You can cancel your subscription at any time by contacting us directly via email. Please be advised that you must contact the Exit Beacon team during the working hours (Mon-Fri, 9:00am - 17:30pm). Your cancellation cannot be processed unless it's during the above times and takes place at least 12hrs before the renewal is due.</p>
                <p>Renewal of service: For monthly, six monthly, annual subscriptions, renewal happens automatically, customers must contact us directly if they wish to cancel.</p>
                <p>No part of the Exit Beacon publication or online listings may be harvested, copied or reproduced by any means whatsoever. Any account attempting to mine or scrape our site will be terminated without a refund.</p>
                <p>Exit Beacon reserves the right to suspend or cancel any subscription account at its sole discretion.</p>
                <p>You are required to keep the contact details that you provided to us up-to-date. We may send notices or other information to you at the address and email address you gave us. We will not pass these details to other companies.</p>
                <p>Exit Beacon advise that recipients carry out further investigations and seek further advice before acting on any information contained on the Exit Beacon website.

                <p>The information herein is not intended to form the basis of any investment decision to purchase any of the businesses in respect of which the information is contained within these pages. These pages are provided to enable the recipient to decide whether he wishes to make further investigations of the businesses of which brief information is provided</p>
                <p>Although we continually update our data, inclusion in this report does not guarantee that any particular company was or still is available for sale or that any potential purchaser will necessarily be able to obtain further information.</p>
                <p>Although we continually update our data and ensure that it is accurate, we cannot guarantee that information provided on companies on Exit Beacon is accurate at all times.</p>
                <p>Information has not necessarily been provided by the vendor or the company purportedly for sale.</p>

                <p>Exit Beacon reserves the right to apply administration and reactivation charges for late payments.</p>
                <p>We will use our reasonable endeavours to maintain all our services. You will not be eligible for any compensation because you cannot use the service or because of a failure, suspension or withdrawal of all or part of the service. We may change the service at any time.</p>
                <p>You understand that there are times when our server may crash or need to be upgraded. As such there will be times of service downtime and thus you will not be able to use the service. You will not be eligible for any compensation in such circumstances. We will use our reasonable endeavours to maintain your services at all times.</p>
                <p>Regardless of anything else in these Terms and Conditions of use, our liability shall not exceed the proportionate amount of your subscription.</p>

                <p>Exit Beacon reserves the right to take legal action to recover any debts.</p>
                <p>Any decision made by Exit Beacon in relation to the services provided and Conditions of Use shall be final.</p>
                <p>Please be advised that Exit Beacon may deem activity on your account to be classified as "unusual and/or harmful activity", such as, though not limited to the following: account is accessed regularly from different IP addresses, attempts at scraping, attempts at undermining Exit Beacon services. In the event where your activity is deemed "unusual and/or harmful" Exit Beacon retains the right to suspend your account and block any access to its system, without processing any refunds or possibility of reinstating your account.</p>
                <p>Please ensure that you are familiar with our privacy policy and our Data Retention Policy.</p>
                <p>These terms do not affect your consumers statutory rights.</p>
